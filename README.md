# 🏨 Hotel Bookings Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a Hotel Bookings dataset to uncover patterns and insights about guest reservations, cancellations, and booking behaviors. The goal is to prepare the data for predictive modeling by performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and preprocessing.

By the end of this stage, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, making it ready for building machine learning models.


## 📂 Dataset

 - Hotel Bookings Dataset
 - Description: The dataset contains booking information for two hotels: a city hotel and a resort hotel. It includes features such as arrival date, length of stay, number of guests, special requests, cancellation status, and more.
  
## 🛠️ Steps Completed
1. Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values (e.g., children, country, agent, company).

- Fixed inconsistent data types (e.g., dates, categorical features).

- Removed irrelevant or duplicate rows.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed customer demographics, distribution channels, and seasonal patterns.

1. Feature Engineering

- Created new features such as:

  - Total guests (adults + children + babies).

  - Stay duration (stays_in_weekend_nights + stays_in_week_nights).

  - Is_family flag.

- Encoded categorical features (e.g., country, distribution channel).

4. Preprocessing

- Standardized/normalized numerical features.

- Applied encoding for categorical features.

1. Train/Test Split

- Final dataset split into 80% training and 20% testing for modeling.

## 🚀 Next Steps

 - Apply machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to predict booking cancellations.

 - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.

 - Deploy the best model in a Streamlit web app for real-time booking prediction.
